I imported a routing system and also twig as the template engine.
Database type (MySQL in this case) is chosen from the config.ini file. Depending on the database type, a controller is called and the connection to the database is established. This allows different DB types to be used, only a separate controller and service.
Email and password validations are done in the model class.
